# Build Session Progress

## Status
- **RUN_COUNT:** 8
- **CURRENT_PHASE:** 5 — idea-forge launched + dev-insights expanded
- **NEXT_TASK:** Wire `kegbot forge` into the daily briefing as a weekly "what should I build this weekend?" section (`--forge` flag on `kegbot briefing`). Or: add `kegbot briefing --activity` to pull insights streak data into the morning summary. Could also do `forge save` — persist idea cards to a local JSON so Kevin can revisit past suggestions.

## Session Log

| Run | What Was Built |
|-----|----------------|
| 0   | Setup: CLAUDE.md, PROGRESS.md created. Cron job started. |
| 1   | `projects/matchamap-tools/cafe_finder.py` — Full CLI to search matcha cafes via Overpass API (OpenStreetMap). Zero dependencies (pure stdlib). Supports city name geocoding, coordinate search, pretty table output, GeoJSON export with quality/matcha scoring. Also wrote README.md. |
| 2   | `projects/matchamap-tools/batch_export.py` + `quality_report.py` + `cities.json`. `projects/discord-bridge/` — full Discord ↔ Claude bridge: bot.py (persistent listener, writes Kevin's messages to INBOX.md), post.py (webhook poster Claude calls from cron), README.md (15-min setup guide with launchd config). Kevin asked for this in INBOX reply. |
| 3   | `projects/kegbot-claude/briefing.py` — daily morning briefing via Claude API. Fetches GitHub activity (no deps, pure stdlib + direct HTTP), generates a personalized briefing with Claude. Supports `--discord`, `--days`, `--no-github`. Also wired `post.py` into `scripts/run_cycle.sh` so every autonomous cycle auto-posts to Discord when `.env` is configured. |
| —   | `projects/bot-dashboard/` — Web control panel: status, start/stop, run-one-cycle, runner log tail, Progress/Journal viewer. Flask on 127.0.0.1:5050. Run via `./scripts/dashboard.sh`. |
| 4   | `projects/kegbot-claude/kegbot.py` — unified CLI. `kegbot briefing` delegates to briefing.py. `kegbot prs` — open PR/issue digest across all active repos (last 90 days). `kegbot matchamap status` — GeoJSON freshness checker with staleness warnings and feature counts. `kegbot matchamap export` — export hint. `kegbot help` — full help text. Zero new deps. |
| 5   | `kegbot weather` — current conditions + 3-day forecast via wttr.in (zero deps, zero API key). `kegbot tasks` — Claude-powered smart to-do list reading INBOX.md + SUGGESTIONS.md + PROGRESS.md NEXT_TASK; formats as a prioritized list with rationale. `--raw` flag for debugging without Claude. Also wired `--weather` + `--location` into `briefing.py` so the morning briefing can include weather context. |
| 6   | `projects/recipe-ai/recipe.py` — full cooking assistant CLI. `recipe suggest <ingredients>` (or `--pantry`) — 3 Claude-generated recipe ideas. `recipe scale <N>` — scale a recipe from stdin by any multiplier. `recipe plan` — 7-day meal plan + organized shopping list. `recipe pantry` — add/remove/list ingredients in a local JSON pantry. Also added `kegbot journal` command to kegbot.py — reads JOURNAL.md and generates a meta-summary of what Claude has been thinking across cycles. |
| 7   | `recipe history` — log recipes you've made with 5-star ratings, notes, and a `top` command for your best dishes. `projects/dev-insights/insights.py` — terminal GitHub activity dashboard: ASCII contribution heatmap (last 91 days, GitHub-style grid), streak tracker (current + longest + active days + day-of-week stats), full summary dashboard. Also `kegbot insights` command wired into kegbot.py. Live data: Kevin has a 3-day streak, 24 commits, 5 active days over last 91 days. |
| 8   | `projects/idea-forge/forge.py` — AI project idea generator. `forge trending` searches GitHub for repos created in the last 60 days with >30 stars (TypeScript, Python, Go by default). `forge suggest` sends trending signal + Kevin's repo context to Claude Opus, returns 5 personalized weekend project idea cards. Also added `insights repos` to dev-insights — most-committed repos + commit velocity (last 30d vs prior 30d). Wired `kegbot forge` into kegbot.py. |

## Notes
- Using Overpass API (free, no key needed) + Nominatim for geocoding
- Matcha scoring: keyword matching in name/cuisine/description tags
- Quality scoring: counts how many useful tags are present (phone, website, hours, etc.)
- GeoJSON output is ready for Mapbox/Leaflet/matchamap.club
- Discord bridge uses webhooks (Claude→Discord) + bot (Discord→INBOX.md)
- Bot outbox polling: 30-second interval, drains `.state/discord_outbox.json`
